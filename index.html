                <img class="profile-pic" src="images/facial.jpg" alt="Photo of Matt Augsburger">
                <p>Matt Augsburger spent his early life in the midwestern U.S., enjoying small town life and the leisure it lends. Matt enrolled at Harding University in Searcy, AR shortly after graduating from Eureka High. Matt was interested in many areas of discipline and struggled to find a major to focus on. Eventually landing on kinesiology, Matt graduated in 2012 and shortly after moved to Nashville, TN. Matt stayed in Nashville for less than a year before moving back to central Illinois and focusing on his fitness career. Matt worked for a community center gym for three years before taking a leap of faith and starting his own personal training and group fitness business, appropriately named Augsburger Fitness. Matt found out after less than a year that the entrepenuer life wasn't for him, and missing the social life that Nashville provided, he headed back to the Music City in July of 2016. After weighing his career options and goals, Matt decided to return to school, and in February of 2017 was accepted to Nashville Software School. Matts can usually be found coding, running, or rock climbing. </p>

                    <h3>Here Goes</h3>
                    <p id="blog1">My first week has certainly been interesting. I had no idea what to expect coming in. I already am taking to the teaching style and progressing more quickly than I had anticipated. I learned how to effectively use the console and git with no previous knowledge on the subject. This was about the only Team Treehouse video that I didn't make it through. I also jumped to the more difficult javascript exercises after getting bored working with HTML. I had a ton of questions, but I managed to make to programs that work to the desired effect. I'm not gettting as much done at home as I would like, but I am gennerally happy with my current status.</p>

                    <h3>Getting into a Rythym</h3>
                    <p>Week two has been a trip. I have become very comfortable with the git system. I don't neccesarily like it, but I get it. I have nearly completed all the exercises for the first milestone and feel comfortable with most of this baseline skills in html css and javascript. I spent most of the week working on my flexbox skills. I didn't get to work with javascript as much as I would have liked, but overall I am satisfied with my progress through this week. Also, I'm getting into my first team lead, so we shall see how that goes.</p>
